"Nginx is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse "
"proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. Nginx is known for its high "
"performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low "
"resource consumption."

"Unlike traditional servers, Nginx doesn't rely on threads to handle "
"requests. Instead it uses a much more scalable event-driven (asynchronous) "
"architecture. This architecture uses small, but more importantly, "
"predictable amounts of memory under load. Even if you don't expect to handle"
" thousands of simultaneous requests, you can still benefit from Nginx's "
"high-performance and small memory footprint. Nginx scales in all directions:"
" from the smallest VPS all the way up to large clusters of servers."
